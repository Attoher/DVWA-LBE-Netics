## Overview

The security assessment was performed from **Sep 13th, 2024 to Sep 19th, 2024**. It aimed to evaluate the external security posture of Demo Companyâ€™s infrastructure using the NIST SP 800-115 Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment and the OWASP Testing Guide (v4). 

## Assessment Phases

1. **Planning**: Gathering customer goals and rules of engagement.
2. **Discovery**: Scanning and enumeration to identify vulnerabilities.
3. **Attack**: Exploitation of vulnerabilities to test security.
4. **Reporting**: Documenting the findings and recommendations.

The following critical vulnerabilities were discovered during the external penetration test:
- **SQL Injection (Blind)**: Allowed attackers to extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Command Injection**: Exploited to gain unauthorized access.
- **File Upload**: Enabled the upload of malicious files that could be executed on the server.

Other vulnerabilities identified include:
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- XSS Stored and Reflected
- JavaScript vulnerabilities

## Severity Ratings

- **Critical**: Exploitation is straightforward and usually results in system-level compromise.
- **High**: Exploitation is more difficult but can lead to loss of data or elevated privileges.
- **Moderate**: Vulnerabilities exist but are harder to exploit.
- **Low**: Non-exploitable vulnerabilities, but they reduce the attack surface.

## Recommendations

The report provides specific actions to mitigate the vulnerabilities:
- Implement **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** to prevent unauthorized access.
- Restrict **login attempts** to prevent brute force attacks.
- Improve **password policies** to reduce predictability.
- Sanitize all inputs to prevent **SQL injection** and **command injection** attacks.
